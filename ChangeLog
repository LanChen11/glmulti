glmulti package changelog:

Version: 0.5-3 (2009-09-15)
Fixed: some issues in the coding of models

Version: 0.6-1 (2009-11-25)
fixed: some issues when using marginality and several covariate:covariate interactions.
glmulti now uses a S4 class ans S4 methods. It returns an object instead of writing a file.
Formulas are accepted to specify the candidate set of models.
Additional functions are provided to help representation of the results, model-averaging 
and parallel computating (plot.glmulti, print.glmulti, summary.glmulti, coef.glmulti, predict.glmulti, consensus).
QAIC and QAICc are now builtin.
The genetic algorithm is now much faster.  

Version: 0.6-2 (2009-12-1)
fixed: bug when using plot.glmulti with type="s"
fixed: startup of the java VM
fixed: minor bug when using method="r"

Version: 0.6-3 (2010-09-1)
added: weightable function to automatically generate a table of IC values and weights (thanks to Jarrett Byrnes)
added: out-of-the-box support for negative binomial glms (glm.nb)
fixed: bug when using predict and coef on lists of glmulti objects, and when feeding newdata to predict (thanks to Jarrett Byrnes)
